                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
                  <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                  <li>12 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
                  <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
                  <li>1 cup hot water</li>
                  <li>1/2 cup evaporated milk</li>
                  <li>3 large eggs </li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                </ul>

              <div id="Instructions">
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>In a bowl, combine the flour and salt. The butter should
                    be just soft enough that it gives when you press it, but
                    not so soft that it collapses. Basically, you want it to be
                    soft enough to break up with your fingers, but it shouldn’t
                    immediately form a paste with the flour.</li>
                  <li>Cut the butter into small cubes, and add it to the flour
                    and salt. Working quickly, break it up roughly with your
                    fingers until it resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized
                    chunks of butter still in the mixture.</li>
                  <li>Add 2 tablespoons of cold water, and bring the dough
                    together with your hands. Add a little more water if
                    necessary (start with 1/2 teaspoon), no more than 2
                    teaspoons. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic or a reusable
                    bag, and refrigerate for 20 minutes.</li>
                  <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a
                    roughly 6×15 inch rectangle. Work quickly to avoid
                    overworking it.</li>
                  <li>Fold the top third of the dough down to the center, then
                    the bottom third up and over that. Give the dough a quarter
                    turn (left or right) and roll out again to a 6×15 inch
                    rectangle. Fold the same way as before, cover, and chill
                    for 1 hour.</li>
                  <li>While the dough is resting, make the filling. Dissolve
                    the sugar into 1 cup of hot water, and allow the mixture
                    to cool to room temperature. Whisk evaporated milk, eggs,
                    and vanilla together, and then thoroughly whisk in the sugar
                    water. Strain through a fine meshed strainer into a large
                    measuring cup or pitcher (something with a pour spout). You
                    should have about 2 to 2 1/4 cups of custard.</li>
                  <li>Preheat the oven to 375° F/190°C, and position a rack in
                    the lower third of your oven.</li>
                  <li>Roll out the dough 0.2 inch/5mm thick, and cut into 4-inch
                    circles to fit either mini tart tins or a shallow non-stick
                    standard muffin pan, leaving a lip going over the top of the
                    cup (the tart shells will shrink as they bake, so you want
                    ample clearance). Take the excess dough, re-roll it, and
                    cut more circles until you have around 16 of them.</li>
                  <li>Evenly fill the tart shells about three quarters full. If
                    you have an ample lip of dough at the top, you can fill it
                    just until you reach the part where the dough curves outward.</li>
                  <li>Once filled, immediately (but very slowly and carefully)
                    transfer the pan to the oven. Immediately reduce the heat to
                    350°F/180°C, and bake for 26-29 minutes, until filling is
                    just set (if a toothpick can stand up in it, it’s done).</li>
                  <li>Allow the tarts to cool for at least 10 minutes
                     before enjoying.</li>
