                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <h4>Bread Dough:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>1 1/2 cups glutinous rice flour</li>
                  <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
                  <li>1/4 cup boiling water</li>
                  <li>1/4 cup room temperature water</li>
                  <li>7 ounces lotus paste or red bean paste</li>
                  <li>1/4 cup sesame seeds</li>
                  <li>4 cups peanut or vegetable oil</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div id="Instructions">
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>Choose your filling—You can buy ready-made filling pastes
                    at the Asian or Chinese grocery store, or use our lotus
                    paste or red bean paste recipes. We used lotus paste.</li>
                  <li>Make sesame ball dough. Place 1/2 cup (60g) glutinous rice
                    flour and sugar in a bowl. Pour ¼ cup (60g) of boiling water
                    into the flour and sugar. Mix with a rubber spatula until
                    smooth. Let sit for 5 minutes. Add ¼ cup + 1 tablespoon
                    (70g) room temperature water and the rest of the glutinous
                    flour (1 cup, 120g). Mix with a spatula until it forms a
                    dough, and all the flour has been incorporated. Cover with
                    an overturned plate or put it in a reusable silicone bag.
                    Set aside to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Prepare your sesame seeds by pouring them in a fine-meshed
                    strainer and rinsing them until they're completely soaked.
                    Let the excess water drain and place the sesame seeds on a
                    plate. Spread them out evenly with enough space for rolling
                    the sesame balls. You can use a paper towel if the sesame
                    seeds are very wet. They should be moist, but not dripping
                    wet.</li>
                  <li>Your filling should be half the weight of your dough ball.
                    Use your kitchen scale to measure out 8 pieces of lotus or
                    red bean paste that weigh 24g each. Roll them into balls and
                    set aside.</li>
                  <li>Weigh the dough ball on a digital kitchen scale – it should
                    weigh about 370 to 380 grams. Whatever your weight is, divide
                    it by 8 to get the weight for each dough ball (in our case,
                    we got 47g). Using the kitchen scale, separate the dough
                    into 8 equal pieces, and roll them into balls. Set them
                    aside on a plate, and cover them so they don’t dry out.</li>
                  <li>To assemble, flatten the dough ball until it is 3 inches
                    in diameter – the middle should be slightly thicker. Place
                    1 ball of filling in the center of the dough, wrapping the
                    dough around the ball. Pinch the dough together so it covers
                    all the filling, making the thickness of the dough as even
                    as possible. You can pinch excess dough from the point where
                    the sesame ball is sealed to fill empty spots or reinforce
                    areas that look thin.</li>
                  <li>After the filling is completely covered, gently press it
                    all together to form a ball, rolling it between the palms of
                    your hands until the seams disappear, and you form a uniform
                    round ball.</li>
                  <li>Roll the ball in the moistened sesame seeds until the
                    entire ball is thoroughly covered. Roll the ball again in
                    your hands to press the sesame seeds into the dough and
                    place on parchment paper until they are ready to deep-fry.</li>
                  <li>Heat 4 cups of peanut or canola oil in a medium deep pot
                    to a stable 320°F/160°C. (Use a thermometer for accuracy,
                    as achieving the right oil temperature is extremely important.)
                    The oil should fill the pot about halfway.</li>
                  <li>Add 4 sesame balls into the oil, and immediately use a
                    slotted spoon to gently move them in a circular motion so
                    they do not stick to the pot. This is a necessary step
                    throughout the entire process to ensure even frying. Don’t
                    leave them unattended. Adding the sesame balls will lower
                    the oil temperature down below 300°F/150°C, but shouldn’t
                    take it below 290°F/143°C. Adjust the heat slightly higher
                    or lower to maintain the oil temperature at 300°F/150°C.</li>
                  <li>After 10 minutes, your sesame balls will begin to float to
                    the top of the oil. Now, your technique changes to keep them
                    rolling in the oil so all sides get the same frying time.
                    You can also occasionally press all four sesame balls down
                    using a slotted spoon or small spider to keep them submerged
                    in the oil. Do this for 2-3 minutes.</li>
                  <li>At this stage, increase the heat to bring the oil
                    temperature gradually up to 350°F. Fry them for another 5
                    minutes, for a total of 17-18 minutes, or until they turn a
                    light golden brown. This last stage of frying at a higher
                    temperature browns them. The sesame balls will expand and
                    grow slightly at this higher oil temperature. The outer crust
                    is now strong enough such that they should not burst, as long
                    as you don’t have any weak or thin spots in the dough.</li>
                  <li>Transfer the finished sesame balls to a strainer, cooling
                    rack or plate lined with paper towels for the oil to drain.
                    Repeat with the second batch. Cool for 10 minutes and serve.</li>
