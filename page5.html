              </div>
              <div id="Instructions">
                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <h4>Prepare Tang Zhong:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Place milk and the bread flour in a small saucepan. Whisk
                    until there is no more lumps. Cook this mixture over medium
                    heat until it is thickened, about 5 minutes or less. Remove
                    from the heat and let it cools down completely</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Make the dough:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Mix all the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.
                    Make a well in the center and pour in the wet ingredients
                    and the tang zhong you made earlier. Use a dough hook
                    attachment to knead the dough until all the crumbly dough
                    starts to come together into one mass, it may take about
                    2-3 minutes for this to happen. Don't be tempted to add any
                    liquid. You may need to stop halfway and scrap the dough off
                    the hook and the sides of the bowl and knead again several
                    times</li>
                  <li>Once it comes into a dough, stop the machine. The dough
                    will not be smooth, don't worry.Cover the dough and let it
                    rest for 20 minutes. This is an important rest that bakers
                    refer to as an autolyse (though in our case it's a short one.
                    Read my post above for detail)</li>
                  <li>After the rest, turn on and knead the dough again and
                    knead for 1-2 minutes until it is a bit smoother. Then add
                    the salt and sugar into the dough. Continue to knead until
                    the dough is relatively smooth. You need to stop and scrape
                    the dough off the hook and the bowl several times during
                    this process. I promise it's worth the effort!</li>
                  <li>Once you have a smooth dough, turn the machine back on
                    again to knead and gradually add in the softened butter a
                    bit by a bit. The dough will turn into a REAL sticky mess
                    again because of the butter, just keep kneading and stop
                    halfway and scrape the dough off the hook and bowl again
                    and continue to knead until the butter is absorbed by the
                    dough. </li>
                  </ol>
                <h4>1st Proofing:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Place this dough in a lightly oiled large bowl, cover it
                    with a clean and damp tea cloth or plastic wrap and let it
                    rise at a warm place for about 1 hour. It may not double in
                    size, but it will puff up some for sure.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Shaping:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Punch the dough down, divide into 8 large balls</li>
                  <li>Pull and tuck the dough to form a smooth round ball or
                    slightly oval (it's up to you) with the seams tucked
                    underneath. Place the seam side down on a baking pan lined
                    with parchment paper and repeat with the rest of the dough.
                    Cover with a plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>2nd Proofing:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Let the doughs proof again for another 30-40 minutes or
                    until they puff up again to about 50% or more of their
                    original size. Brush the top of the dough with egg wash</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Baking:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Preheat oven to 350 F (177 C) and pop it into the oven
                    (3rd rack from the top) and let them bake for the next 20-30
                    minutes depending on the oven, mine took 20 minutes. It will
                    be golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let it cool
                    down in the pan for about 5 minutes and then let them cool
                    completely on a cooling rack</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Topping:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Mix kewpie mayo and condensed milk in a bowl. Stir to mix.
                    Yes, that's all you need to do. On another bowl, combine the
                    pork floss, sesame seeds, and roasted seaweed strips</li>
                  <li>Once the buns have cooled down, brush the top of the bun
                    with the mayo sauce mixture you make above. If you plan to
                    serve 5 buns, then dress 5 of them. Don't dress all of them
                    ahead of time and keep for the next day or so as things will
                    get soggy</li>
                  <li>Gently press the bun (the side with the mayo sauce) into
                    the floss mixture. Repeat with the next buns and serve</li>
                </ol>
